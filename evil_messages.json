["The seas will run red with your blood.",
"Soon.",
"Death. Death. Death.",
"You think you are safe. Nobody will be safe from what is to come.",
"I bring a message of doom upon your house.",
"All will perish under His dread hand.",
"Was it worth it? The things you did. I still suffer from what you have wrought.",
"I am counting the days until your death."]
